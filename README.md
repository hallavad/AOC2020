# Day 1
Simple solution with dual loops for part a and triple loop for part b.
Since the first value has been checked for all possible alternatives the second value will always start one above the prior one.

The alternate solution of part a makes use of sorting the list and then excluding the values at the end until it finds the correct ones that.
