# Day 1
Simple solution with dual loops for part a and triple loop for part b.
Slightly optimized by starting the next loop one above the previous one since the earlier values has been checked with all possible values already.

The alternate solution of part a makes use of sorting the list and then excluding the values at the end until it finds the correct ones that.
